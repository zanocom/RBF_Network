RBF_Network
===========
RBF network functions

The repository contains code by Joao Nieto ( http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/r/rbf/rbf.html ).

The files are:
* rbf.R           # compute a RBF model
* rbf_predict.R   # predict values given a rbf model


The functions are edited in order to improve performance substituting for loops with apply.
